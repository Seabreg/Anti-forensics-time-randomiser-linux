A tool to spoof a forensics investigator by randomising the hardware clock so it is difficult to tell when a files were written, making the job much harder and time consuming.
Note: NTP clock must be turned off for this to work. If it is not the clock will stay synced using the NTP server instead of the hardware clock. It was tested on Arch Linux.
